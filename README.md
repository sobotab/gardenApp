This Garden Design Software is being created with the purpose of helping beginner gardeners learn about native species. They can learn about native plants as they build their ultimate lep sanctuary.

Currently, the software allows for drawing a custom garden, dragging and dropping plants into the garden, and learning about each plant species in the info menu.

Drawing a garden: 

The user can use their mouse to draw a garden that will most accurately depict their own land's shape. This is advantageous over predetermined shapes that would not necessarily fit the user's needs.

Dragging and Dropping plants:

Dragging and Dropping from a plant bank is an intuitive way for the user to customize their garden. If a mistake is made, the user can drag their plant to the compost bin and choose another one. Also, this will account for the plants' spreads in the future.

Info Menu:

The info menu serves as a glossary in which plants can rotated around a "carousel" and can be clicked in order to bring up a popup window with additional information. This screen will also allow for the plant options in the carousel to be filtered by attributes such as moisture, sun, and soil requirements.

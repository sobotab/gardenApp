This Garden Design Software is being created with the purpose of helping beginner gardeners learn about native species. They can learn about native plants as they build their ultimate lep sanctuary.

The software allows users to draw a garden, choose the moisture, sun, soil type, and budget that fits their needs, select plants that are filtered by their decisions, drag and drop plants in a top-down garden, save/load thier gardens by name, and view plant info in a glossary.

Drawing a garden: 

The user can use their mouse to draw a garden that will most accurately depict their own land's shape. This is advantageous over predetermined shapes that would not necessarily fit the user's needs. The garden is now on a grid to provide scaling, this also allows the plant images to change size relative to the area of the garden.

Selecting Plants:

On the draw garden screen, the user will be able to choose one or multiple soil types, a moisture level, and a sunlight level for their garden. On the next screen, a carousel of plants that have been filtered based on the user's decisions will be displayed. These plants can be clicked to be added to a list of selected plants. If clicked again, the plant will be deselected and go back in the carousel. The selected plants will be sent to the editGarden screen so the user can drag them into the garden.

Dragging and Dropping plants:

Dragging and Dropping from a plant bank is an intuitive way for the user to customize their garden. If a mistake is made, the user can drag their plant to the compost bin and choose another one. The plants that are dragged in turn red if they are in an invalid area (outside of the garden on in the wrong soil type), but can still be placed there if the user wishes to. Additionally, the plants turn yellow if they are overlapping according to their root spreads. Another interesting feature is that the number of lep species supported by the garden and the user's budget are dynamically updated as plants are dragged in.

Save/Load:

Once the user has created a garden, they can save it under any name they would like, and their garden can be accessed again from the "open" screen. In the future this screen should give more information than just the garden's name (like lep count and cost).

Info Menu:

The info menu serves as a glossary in which plants can rotated around a "carousel" and can be clicked in order to bring up a popup window with additional information. This screen  allows for the plant options in the carousel to be filtered by attributes such as moisture, sun, and soil requirements.

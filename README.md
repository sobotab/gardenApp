This Garden Design Software is being created with the purpose of helping beginner gardeners learn about native species. They can learn about native plants as they build their ultimate lep sanctuary.

The software allows users to draw a garden, choose the moisture, sun, soil type, and budget that fits their needs, select plants that are filtered by their decisions, drag and drop plants in a top-down garden, save/load thier gardens by name, and view plant info in a glossary.

Drawing a garden: 

The user can use their mouse to draw a garden that will most accurately depict their own land's shape. This is advantageous over predetermined shapes that would not necessarily fit the user's needs. The garden is now on a grid to provide scaling, this also allows the plant images to change size relative to the area of the garden.

The user chooses a sun and moisture level for their garden, as well as the soil type for each plot of land they draw. Additionally, the user can type in a budget that will be remembered as they place plants in their garden.

Selecting Plants:

On the draw garden screen, the user will be able to choose one or multiple soil types, a moisture level, and a sunlight level for their garden. On the next screen, a carousel of plants that have been filtered based on the user's decisions will be displayed. These plants have an add button that can be clicked to be added to a list of selected plants. If the remove button that appears is clicked, the plant will be deselected and go back in the carousel. The selected plants will be sent to the editGarden screen so the user can drag them into the garden. If the plant's images are clicked, a popup will come up with more information about that plant.

Additionally, the user can filter their plant options by plant type and specific soil type (if they included more than one in their garden) so that they can find their desired plants more easily.

Dragging and Dropping plants:

Dragging and Dropping from a plant bank is an intuitive way for the user to customize their garden. If a mistake is made, the user can drag their plant to the compost bin and choose another one. The plants that are dragged in turn red if they are in an invalid area (outside of the garden on in the wrong soil type), but can still be placed there if the user wishes to. Additionally, the plants turn yellow if they are overlapping according to their root spreads. Another interesting feature is that the number of lep species supported by the garden and the user's budget are dynamically updated as plants are dragged in.

The plants that are dragged in can differentiate between multiple soil types in a garden, but some plants can be planted in any soil type! 

In addition to the budget and number of leps supported, the most supported lep species are kept track of on this screen. The butterflies and moths' scientific names are displayed on the right side of the screen along with the number of plants that are supporting them. If the "See More" button is clicked, a popup will appear that shows the same information along with an image of the lep.

Save/Load/Print:

Once the user has created a garden, they can save it under any name they would like, and their garden can be accessed again from the "open" screen. On the open screen, some infromation about the gardens are shown such as lep count and budget.

The user can also save their garden as an image using the print button.

Info Menu:

The info menu serves as a glossary in which plants can rotated around a "carousel" and can be clicked in order to bring up a popup window with additional information. This screen allows for the plant options in the carousel to be filtered by attributes such as moisture, sun, and soil requirements. 

Resources Page:

The Resources Page has some basic information about native plants and lepidoptera, as well as some links to more in depth sources.

Enjoy the program!
